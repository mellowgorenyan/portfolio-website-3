    <img id="img1" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4b/9a/76/4b9a7627c8191e30923cbdd2517ca155.jpg">
    <br>I am Winny A. Verzosa, 19 years of age, born on July 14, 2006 in Quezon City, Philippines. </br>
    <br>I live in Project 4, QC and currently a senior high student under the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) strand at Quirino High School. </br>
    <br>I completed my elementary level at Project 3 Elementary School and finished my junior high school at Quirino High School. </br>
    <br>I am the third of four children of Raul O. Verzosa and Rosemarie T. Aquino. </br>
  </p>

    <br>I did not grew up as an excellent child, in fact I am a slow learner and it's quite hard for me to adapt to changes.</br> 
    <br>It's not easy for me to socialize as it gets hard for me to communicate and express my feelings at times, </br>
    <img id="img3" src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/-ppimn_IwNcAAAAd/fatass-teto-teto-plush.gif">
    <br>I also find handling long-term relationships with my friends difficult as I tend to push people away. </br>
    <br>I spend my free time engaging in personal interests such as playing video games, reading random stuff, watching anime, exploring the internet, and listening to music.</br> 
    <br>I also enjoy going out when it rains, as I find peace and comfort in that atmosphere.</br>
  </p>
  <p style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;font-style:italic;">
    <br>I grew up with my mom and dad, along with my siblings until I turned 15—when my mom left us. Since then, my siblings and I have lived under the same roof with our father. </br>
    <br>Life hasn't been easy ever since; I've faced some personal struggles that affected my education and well-being and I had to drop Grade 11 (GAS) due to my poor mental state. </br>
    <br>There were a lot of difficult moments in my life that made me feel hopeless, but they taught me resilience and self-awareness, which I'm thankful of.</br>
