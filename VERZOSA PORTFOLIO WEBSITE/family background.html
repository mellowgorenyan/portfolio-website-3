		<br>We are a family of six (including me) from Quezon City, Philippines. </br>
		<br>My father, Raul O. Verzosa, is employed at the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) working for the development and maintenance of public infrastructure.</br>
		<br>My mother, Rosemarie T. Aquino, no longer lives with us, and we currently have limited contact with her.</br>
		<br>My eldest brother, Mervin Aries A. Verzosa, will start his fourth year in college this August.</br> 
		<br>My second brother, Patrick Raliegh A. Verzosa, works as a part-timer.</br> 
		<br>I am the third of four children, Winny A. Verzosa, I'm currently a senior high student (Grade 11) at Quirino High School</br>
		<br>and our youngest sister, Queeny A. Verzosa, is in Grade 8, who's also enrolled at the same school with me.</br>

		<br>My family is quite complicated, we often experience misunderstandings that leads to arguments, my mom no longer resides with us ever since they separated,</br> 
		<br> and we do not follow any particular family traditions.</br>
		<br>Still, we always try to find ways to have a good connection with each others and maintain a good relationship.</br>
