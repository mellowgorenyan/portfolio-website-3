		<br>I am Winny A. Verzosa, 19 years of age, born on July 14, 2006 in Quezon City, Philippines. </br>
		<br>I live in Project 4, QC and currently a senior high student under the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) strand at Quirino High School. </br>
		<br>I completed my elementary level at Project 3 Elementary School and finished my junior high school at Quirino High School. </br>
		<br>I am the third of four children of Raul O. Verzosa and Rosemarie T. Aquino. </br>

	<img src="C:\Users\Linnaeus\Pictures\teto.jpg" style="float:right;width:57px;height:57px;">
		<br>I did not grew up as an excellent child, in fact I am a slow learner and it's quite hard for me to adapt to changes.</br> 
		<br>It's not easy for me to socialize as it gets hard for me to communicate and express my feelings at times, </br>
		<img src="C:\Users\Linnaeus\Pictures\tetoo.jpg" style="float:right;width:57px;height:57px;">
		<br>I also find handling long-term relationships with my friends difficult as I tend to push people away. </br>
		<br>I spend my free time engaging in personal interests such as playing video games, reading random stuff, watching anime, exploring the internet, and listening to music.</br> 
		<br>I also enjoy going out when it rains, as I find peace and comfort in that atmosphere.</br>
	</p>
	<p style =  "color:black;font-family: font-family: Arial;font-size:14px;font-style:italic;">
		<br>I grew up with my mom and dad, along with my siblings until I turned 15—when my mom left us. Since then, my siblings and I have lived under the same roof with our father. </br>
		<br>Life hasn't been easy ever since; I've faced some personal struggles that affected my education and well-being and I had to drop Grade 11 (GAS) due to my poor mental state. </br>
		<br>There were a lot of difficult moments in my life that made me feel hopeless, but they taught me resilience and self-awareness, which I'm thankful of.</br>
